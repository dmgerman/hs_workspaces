- basic infrastructure to keep track of which worskpace a given
  window is at

- For every window we keep:
  - if the window is everywhere
  - if the window is hidden
  - its workspace
  - its frame when not hidden

* TODOS    

** NEXT activate one of the windows in the space

- i guess I have to check the stack and find the latest
- find first window 

** TODO the first space should not have ALL windows  

** TODO what about multiple screens?

I guess at this point only deal with one screen.

Windows are managed if they are in the main screen


** TODO Hide windows not in workspace

** TODO callback for focus

- in that case, move the workspace where the window is and
  move it back into place

** TODO goto workspace
