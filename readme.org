* Log

** [2024-08-25 Sun]

- lots of improvements and clean up of the code

- hs_workspaces:
  - only manages primary screen
  - only manages non-sticky windows    
  - only keeps the minimal info:
    - it only tracks info of windows in workspaces
    - a window is hidden if it is in the storage area


** [2024-08-21 Wed]

- basic infrastructure to keep track of which worskpace a given
  window is at

- For every window we keep:
  - if the window is everywhere
  - if the window is hidden
  - its workspace
  - its frame when not hidden




* TODOS    

** DONE activate one of the windows in the space
CLOSED: [2024-08-24 Sat 11:21]

- i guess I have to check the stack and find the latest
- find first window

** CANCELLED what about multiple screens?
CLOSED: [2024-08-24 Sat 11:21]

I guess at this point only deal with one screen.

Windows are managed if they are in the main screen

No, too problematic to support now, and the biggest benefit will always be in laptops

** DONE Hide windows not in workspace
CLOSED: [2024-08-24 Sat 11:21]

** DONE callback for focus
CLOSED: [2024-08-24 Sat 11:22]

- in that case, move the workspace where the window is and
  move it back into place

** DONE goto workspace
CLOSED: [2024-08-24 Sat 11:22]

** DONE the menu bar seems to be a bit buggy                            :bug:
CLOSED: [2024-08-25 Sun 15:57]


** DONE ignored windows and menu bar:
CLOSED: [2024-08-25 Sun 15:57]

- they need their special place

** NEXT support prev/next ws

- moving windows 
- moving to ws

** DONE when switching ws the number of windows is incorrect            :bug:
CLOSED: [2024-08-25 Sun 15:57]

** DONE when moving a window outside screen                             :bug:
CLOSED: [2024-08-25 Sun 15:57]

- the window should become unmanaged

** DONE moving window within screen                                     :bug:
CLOSED: [2024-08-25 Sun 15:57]

- the fr should be nil unless moved to storage
